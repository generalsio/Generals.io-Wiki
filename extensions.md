# Extensions

Extensions are user-made scripts which provide small quality-of-life adjustments to generals.io. All of the listed extensions on this page are allowed and approved by the game developers.

## Installation

In order to use the extensions below:

1. Install a browser extension called Tampermonkey (see [https://www.tampermonkey.net/](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)).
2. Click on the link to the extension you want to install.

**If the extension has an asterisk next to its name:**

3. Highlight the whole script (all of the code on the screen) and copy it.
4. Go to the Tampermonkey dashboard and click the plus sign.
5. Paste in the script and press Ctrl+s to save it.

**Otherwise:**

3. Click the "Raw" button on the page you are sent to, which is next to the name of the extension (usually ending in .user.js).
4. Click "Install" when Tampermonkey prompts you to install the extension.

Now if you reload, you should be able to see the effects of the script!
